//What does the script do? 
// It  splits the CVs in forward and backward scan into a seperate Sheet2 and reverses the Backward scan. In Sheet3 forward and backward scans are averaged. The averaged curves are then plotted.
// You can run another script afterwards to calculate the current densities

//Important prerequesite for the Data structure: How does my data should look like?
//Raw Data in Sheet1, no other Sheets in the Origin Workbook. 
//Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) Data with Potential in the X Column and Current in the Y Column. 
//Eset (Setpoint Potential) = E2 (second Vertex Potential)-> Raw Data contains Cycling only between E1 and E2; 
//Numeric seperator 1.000,00
//You can analyse as many CVs as you like.
//The Comment File of the X Column should contain Data, that allows to identify the File. 
//The comment file of the Y Column should contain information, that allows to compare the polarisation curves with each other in the produced plot.
